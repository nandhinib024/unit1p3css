                Botany is the scientific study of plants. 
                "Plants," to most people, means a wide range of living organisms from the smallest bacteria to the largest living things - 
                the giant sequoia trees. By this definition plants include: algae, fungi, lichens, mosses, ferns, conifers and flowering plants. 
                Today scientists believe bacteria, algae and fungi are in their own distinct kingdoms, 
                but most general botany courses, 
                and most Botany Departments at colleges and universities, 
                still teach about these groups.
